# Hashtables:
###### hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Challenge:
##### add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

##### get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

##### contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

##### hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.



## Approach & Efficiency : 
#### add: time O(1) space O(1)
#### get : time O(1) space O(1)
#### hash: time O(1) space O(1)
#### contains: time O(1) space O(1)
